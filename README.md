# itsme
itsme is a php library for implementing a simple token based authentication mechanism

- itsme needs a mysql database. You can setup your connection parameters in the constants.php file.
- the second step is running the script setup_itsme.php - this script will create the necessary tables. 
it doesn't create any db so be sure your database already exists.
